Cardano’s weekly chart isn’t showing strong momentum right now, and based on current price action, it may still be early in this corrective cycle. The recent dump looks more like the beginning of a broader move, so for heavy investment, waiting for a much cheaper price and the start of a fresh cycle is the smarter play. ▶️

Until then, the better approach is to trade the swings. The next meaningful move should carry ADA toward wave B, where a strong support zone could temporarily hold the sellers and create a short-term reversal opportunity. 💱

This setup keeps the technical analysis clear: watch the chart closely, monitor support and resistance levels, and follow signals that show whether momentum is shifting.

Correction has now reached **50.09%**, and price has moved exactly along our roadmap into the first major support area. ☄️

While the main buy zone sits near the end of wave (C), we can still expect retracements in the **50%**-**70%** range before the next decisive move forms. 🔝
