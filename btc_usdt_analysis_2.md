On the higher timeframes, the chart shows Bitcoin aiming for lower support levels after completing leg G. 🚩
The recent correction, the break below the D & F trendline, and the strong downside momentum all suggest that the previous cycle has likely come to an end. ☄️

There is still a chance that the support zone around 86k holds and pushes the price upward, potentially transforming the current diametric structure into a symmetric pattern. 📈
This would require a strong technical reaction and clear signals to confirm a reversal.

However, if price dips too deeply into the main support zone, the probability increases that Bitcoin already set its ATH at the end of wave G. In that case, we may see further corrections to lower support levels after a short retracement. ⚠️
