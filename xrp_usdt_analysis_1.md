Ripple (XRP) is currently consolidating within a critical support zone. While the anticipated "Spring" move has yet to materialize, bearish sentiment in the market increases the likelihood of a sharp liquidity event forming this spring phase before re-accumulation. Once complete, traders will be watching closely for the SOS (Sign of Strength) to confirm recovery potential.

The XRPUSDT chart indicates that the re-accumulation phase for Ripple is still ongoing, though the recent crypto market correction has slowed down the pattern’s progression. ☄️ Traders should remain patient, as the next moves will depend on how price reacts to key support levels.

🔹 Two Scenarios to Watch 🥇🥈

## Spring Already Happened: 🔜

The recent correction could be the S (Spring) move.

If true, the next pullback will act as the LPS (Last Point of Support).

This setup may allow XRP to reach new all-time highs (ATH) sooner than expected.

## Spring Yet to Come:

The recent correction might be only a preliminary move.

The actual Spring move could still be ahead, requiring further downside before accumulation completes.

## Key Support Zone to Monitor 👀

To determine which scenario will unfold, traders should watch the first highlighted support zone carefully.

A strong reaction here may confirm Scenario 1, signaling bullish continuation.

Weak support or rejection could indicate Scenario 2, implying more downside before a meaningful rally.

Step-by-step updates will be crucial for XRP traders to track how this re-accumulation pattern develops. 💡
