🔎 **Market Reaction**  
Price has rebounded more than 40% since the last liquidity-driven move. Key resistance lies near 166 USDT — a confirmed close above this level would strengthen the bullish case.

🚀 **Performance Update**  
The setup has delivered ~35% profit on spot and up to 75% for those entering near the liquidity zone. A confirmed break above 166 USDT signals sentiment shift. Partial profit-taking is advised while awaiting the next pullback signal.

💡 **Technical Outlook**  
Solana is positioned within a Wyckoff re-accumulation phase, completing Wave B of an Elliott Wave structure.  
- **Bullish case:** breakout above 179 USDT → Wave C targets $386, $787, and $1,566.  
- **Bearish case:** rejection at 179 USDT may invalidate the setup and shift into distribution.

📌 **Resistance Test**  
Solana has rallied ~40% and is testing major resistance. This is a key decision zone where large players will determine continuation or rejection.

🪙 **Accumulation Signal**  
Solana is up 50% with strong buying pressure. With $180 now acting as support and a confirmed LPS, even potential pullbacks would likely present new buying opportunities.

🔎 **Correction Watch**  
Price touched the support zone but has yet to show strong momentum. A reclaim of last week’s red candle would boost bullish continuation. Otherwise, market makers may attempt a fake breakdown before resuming the uptrend.

📊 **Profit Update**  
Another 30% profit since the last update. Booking partial profits is recommended before the anticipated pullback, with re-entry planned at the highlighted support zone aligned with the bullish trendline.

💡 **Pullback in Play**  
As expected, Solana corrected ~15% from the orange resistance zone. The roadmap remains unchanged — the highlighted support zone, aligned with a key trendline and two-year pivot level, offers a high-quality re-entry opportunity.

🚀 **Trend Continuation**  
Solana has climbed steadily over 40% since the entry zone. Price is nearing a key resistance level — reactions here will reveal whether rejection or a breakout occurs. Profit-taking at this zone is logical while preparing to re-enter after wave (B) pullback.

📌 **Correction Phase**  
A 20% retracement has unfolded, confirming wave B is in play. The next bullish impulse (wave C) requires a sharp reversal for momentum to sustain. Until then, accumulation near the highlighted box remains the focus for positioning.

+25% from buy zone!! open positions have reached target area; consider making trades risk-free (move stop to breakeven).

📈 **Why this matters**

Unlike many altcoins, Solana (SOL) didn’t print a heavy bearish candle during the last sell-off — that divergence can mean two things: either SOL has room to retest higher resistance (red scenario), or market makers are accumulating before a heavier dump in the next corrective leg. ⚠️

🎯 **Targets & Obstacles**

The immediate resistance is the big trendline — that’s our first real obstacle (TP1). If price clears that, the red scenario becomes more likely; if rejection is strong, expect deeper correction toward the newly highlighted demand zones. 🧭

🛡 **Risk management (practical)**

With ~25% gain from the buy zone, tighten stops and make positions risk-free now — lock partial profits, then monitor price reaction at the trendline and demand zones before adding exposure. ✔️

👀 **What to watch next**

Reaction at the trendline (rejection vs. clean breakout)
Price behavior inside the two new demand zones (buyers showing strength)
Any large volume spikes that confirm a directional move.

Price has dropped 36.86% since the last update, continuing its move downward with no major supports in between
A clear reminder of why following the chart and roadmap matters. ☄️🔥

As SOL approaches the key support zone, there’s no need to rush. Buy orders inside this area can be placed in steps to DCA safely into the box. 📉

Now we wait to see where wave B completes before the next move develops. 🥸
