Looking at Decentraland’s weekly chart, the overall price action shows that the crypto market is entering the final legs of a redistribution phase. 🫠
Based on the current structure, MANA may leave this long-ranging zone with one last push upward before a deeper correction takes over. This type of movement is common when momentum starts fading and bigger players prepare for accumulation at lower levels. 📉

If you’re planning to invest heavily, the smarter approach is to wait for price to revisit the deeper monthly support zones. These levels usually generate stronger signals, healthier entries, and better long-term setups based on technical analysis. 🐷✨

The yellow zone pushed MANA up more than 65%, and price is still showing strong momentum. 🪙
The key resistance at **$0.41** is now acting as the main decision point. ⚖️
A clean breakout could activate real altseason targets, but failure to break may trigger a bull trap and send price lower for bigger players to re accumulate. 🛒

Hope you took profit near the **$0.41** resistance zone as price has corrected nearly **40%** since touching that level. ☄️
For now, further pullback is still possible as the market seeks new buyers. Keep an eye on each support level as price prepares for another potential retest of resistance. 👀

Price continues to follow our roadmap and is now moving into the supply zone between **$0.41** and **$0.57**. 📈
Many altcoins still carry the possibility of one more correction before a true altseason begins. ⚠️
Only a strong breakout above this zone will invalidate deeper pullback scenarios and build the momentum needed to target higher levels. 🔄

MANA has almost reached our monthly demand zone with calculated swing moves along the way, Exactly as expected. 📊
Now pay attention to both buy zones (black & blue) and plan entries with proper SPOT risk management. ⬆️
Our first target is over **125%**, but catching such moves requires patience and a wider stoploss. 🎯
