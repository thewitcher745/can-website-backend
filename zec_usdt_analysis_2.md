Zcash has been one of the stronger performers in the crypto market lately, leading the privacy narrative and showing impressive strength during wave (A) ⚡. The chart structure and current price action make that growth very clear.

From here, the most reasonable approach is to look for new entries during the pullback in wave (B). This zone usually builds the foundation for the next leg up, and it often comes with cleaner signals and better risk to reward opportunities for the next round of growth ✅.

For anyone considering short positions, waiting for proper triggers is essential. A clear pivotal pattern on lower timeframes, combined with strong technical analysis can offer a reliable hint before entering the market 📈.

Price is still moving inside the distribution range, and since lower levels haven’t been triggered again, the overall bias for ZEC remains bearish. 🐍

At this stage, we’re waiting for the UTAD zone to activate once more, which could set up another clean pullback opportunity. 🐢

The chart is straight forward, just make sure to calculate your potential loss and apply proper risk management before entering any setup. 📝
