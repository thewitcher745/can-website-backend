Ethereum has shown a steady recovery since its Selling Climax phase, and based on the current chart structure, this move could stretch toward a higher resistance zone after one more swing low 📉📈. The overall price action still supports this scenario within the broader market trend.

Once price meets that resistance, the reaction will give us important signals. If the rejection is clear enough, we’ll be waiting at the main buy zone to finish the re-accumulation phase and prepare for the next set of long positions 💵.

The highlighted zones remain the key trading areas on higher timeframes, but scalpers can still spot opportunities on lower timeframes with proper technical analysis, watching the support and resistance flips closely 📌.

Growth since the analysis has reached **7.52%**, and the AR (Automatic Rally) we expected on Ethereum is unfolding smoothly. ⚡️🐂

For now, the key focus is the reaction at the highlighted orange zone. This area will decide whether ETH continues its upward momentum or shifts into a deeper correction. Stay alert to the next signals. 📊
