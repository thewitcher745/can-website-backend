## Risk Assessment

**High Risk Investment:** Combination of meme coin characteristics and presale status creates elevated volatility and liquidity constraints. Limited trading history and speculative nature require stringent risk management protocols.

**Recommended Allocation:** $25 from $1,000 portfolio (2.5% maximum exposure recommended)

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Pre-market liquidity limitations
- Meme coin volatility patterns
- Presale execution risks
- Regulatory uncertainty

## Investment Summary

Layer Brett presents a hybrid approach combining meme token appeal with Layer 2 utility features. The project's emphasis on practical functionality through staking and low-fee transactions differentiates it from traditional meme coins. However, the presale status and meme coin classification warrant conservative position sizing and careful risk management.

**Investment Approach:** Suitable for speculative allocation within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios, with strict adherence to recommended exposure limits.
