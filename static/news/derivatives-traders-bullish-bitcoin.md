Despite historically volatile Septembers, Bitcoin derivatives traders adopt a cautiously optimistic stance. Bitcoin has risen about 3% in the past two days to about $111,000—but CoinGlass data suggests this is driven by passive bids, not aggressive buying.

In the options market, bullish bets for the September 26 expiry are growing, with rising open interest in strike prices of $120K, $130K, and even $140K. Experts like Sean Dawson of Dervie expect market makers to manage volatility either way.

Meanwhile, demand for downside protection has also increased, suggesting cautious optimism. All eyes are on Friday's US jobs report and the Fed's interest rate decision—factors that may determine whether this becomes another "red September."
