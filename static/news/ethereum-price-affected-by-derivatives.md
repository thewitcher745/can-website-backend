Based on a new analysis by Glassnode, Ethereum’s price is more influenced by derivatives markets and off-chain transactions than by direct spot buying and selling. In contrast, Bitcoin continues to benefit from strong demand in the spot market.

Analysts, examining the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) metric, found notable differences between the two leading cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin, after a sharp rally in July, has filled its price gaps with new transactions—indicating sustained spot demand—Ethereum has not shown the same pattern.

## Key Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Bitcoin filled previously empty price levels with fresh trades following its July surge, suggesting ongoing spot-market demand.
- Ethereum, despite price increases, did not fill those gaps, pointing to a greater reliance on derivatives activity.

## Implications for Investors
The analysis suggests Bitcoin continues to enjoy strong direct purchases, whereas Ethereum is more affected by derivatives and complex financial instruments. Ethereum is currently trading around $4,370, down 5% over the past week.
