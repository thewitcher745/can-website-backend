## Technical Highlights of Alpenglow
- Introduces two new consensus components:
  - Votor replaces TowerBFT to speed up finality  
  - Rotor replaces current Proof-of-History scheduling with a novel data propagation model

## Future Outlook
Proposed by the developer group Anza in May 2025, the exact release date has not yet been confirmed. When live, Alpenglow could significantly advance Solana's adoption across payments, trading, and gaming.
