ECB President Christine Lagarde called on regulators to accelerate stricter stablecoin legislation, warning that the current regulatory gaps expose Europe to new financial vulnerabilities.

## Regulatory Gaps in MiCA
Lagarde pointed out that the MiCA framework allows stablecoins to be issued by both European and non-European entities under a "dual issuance" model, but the regulatory requirements don't adequately apply to non-European issuers.

## Call for Stronger Legislation
She urged lawmakers to close these gaps by limiting schemes lacking equivalent protections in other jurisdictions, noting that without global standards, risks could migrate to regions with weaker regulations and undermine Europe's financial structure.
