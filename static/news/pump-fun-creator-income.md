The meme-coin creation platform Pump.fun on Solana revamped its fee model, claiming to increase token creators' income tenfold. Within 24 hours of the update, $2 million was distributed to creators, up from $198,000.

## New Dynamic Fee Model
Fee rates now vary based on a token's market cap:
- Creators of tokens with $88K–$300K market cap earn the highest rate of 0.95%.

## Impact on Live-Streamed Creators
Streamers say this model allows small creators to earn more in a month than larger streamers make in a year. For example, one streamer, Jytol, saw viewers rise from 4 to 15 and daily income increase from $2.33 to $9.30.
