This initiative aims to broaden access to real-world assets (RWA) on-chain, giving investors exposure to US equities in a decentralized and global framework.

The first batch of tokenized stocks will include Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft, with trading accessible to global users outside restrictive jurisdictions. Solana Labs emphasized that tokenization is a key driver for the next phase of blockchain adoption.
