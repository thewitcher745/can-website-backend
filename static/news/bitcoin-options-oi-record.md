Bitcoin options open interest has climbed to $23 billion, according to Deribit data, nearing the all-time record of $24.2B. This surge comes as traders accumulate positions for September expiries.

## Key Strike Price Levels
- Heavy concentration at $100K, $120K strike prices  
- A large number of short positions stacked around $90K  

This reflects heightened expectations of volatility in the coming weeks. Analysts note that liquidity providers will likely manage risks by pushing spot price movements near key levels.
