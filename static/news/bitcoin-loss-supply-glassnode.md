According to Glassnode, only around 9% of Bitcoin's total supply is currently at a loss—significantly lower than previous cycle bottoms, when over 25% was underwater, and during bear markets peaks over 50%.

This indicates that the recent ~13.4% price drop from the all-time high is relatively minor compared to past corrections of 36% or 24%. Analysts like Ted Pillows caution it could resemble a previous 30% correction, potentially breaking below $100,000, although it may not be the cycle top. Meanwhile, Michael van de Poppe suggests the upcoming Fed meeting (September 17) and potential rate cut could halt the correction. Bitcoin is testing a key resistance around $112K, with failure possibly opening a drop to $105K.
