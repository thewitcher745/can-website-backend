# How to Manage your Risk Using Crypto Trading Signals?

No matter how good your crypto signals are, you can’t succeed without proper capital allocation and risk management. Many traders fail not because of bad trades — but because they risk too much or manage their positions poorly.

This guide explains exactly how much capital to use for each trade and how to manage your risk like a pro.

## How Much Capital to Use Per Signal?

### 🟢 Small Capital ($500 – $1,000)

* Invest $25–$50 per entry
* Example: $50 at Entry 1, another $50 at Entry 2
* Take profit early — preferably at TP1
* Bring stop-loss to entry when in profit 🔄

Focus on consistency and protecting your small account. This way you can increase your margin in short time and put aside the original capital in less than a few months and increase your risk exposure step by step once your account is in good profit.

---

### 🟠 Medium Capital ($1,000 – $3,000)

* Use $50–$150 per entry
* Take partial profits at TP1 (at least 50%) and TP2
* Always protect your gains with a stop-loss update to entry after TP1

This gives you flexibility without overexposing your capital.

---

### 🔵 Large Capital ($3,000+)

* Allocate 5% of your total capital per signal
* Follow the professional method:

  * 50% → Target 1
  * 30% → Target 2
  * 20% → Target 3

This structured approach keeps you balanced between profit and protection.

---

## 🚫 Leverage Discipline (Never High Leverage)

High leverage attracts market makers to hunt stop-losses.

Example:

* $1,000 total capital
* 5% position size → $50
* Using 20X leverage → $1,000 position

If stop-loss is 3% →
You lose 30% of your entire account instantly.

Or worse:
Liquidation may hit before stop-loss reaches.

✅ Maximum recommended leverage:

* Swing trades: 3X–5X
* Scalp trades: 10X max — only if very experienced

Leverage multiplies your mistakes faster than your profits.

## 🥇 The GOLDEN RULE

No scenario should ever risk more than 5% - 10% of your total capital — even if all stop-losses hit at the same time.

Before entering any trade:

* Calculate worst-case loss across all active positions
* Make sure it doesn’t exceed 5% - 10% of your portfolio

If you take more trades, you must reduce margin per trade.

This rule is what separates long-term survivors from blown accounts.
