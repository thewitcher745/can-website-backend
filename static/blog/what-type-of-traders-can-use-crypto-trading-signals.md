## 👑 Two Ways to Use Our Crypto Signal Channels

We serve two major types of traders — each using our signals differently based on their goals and knowledge.

### 1️⃣ The Experienced Trader

If you already understand technical analysis, you can use our charts and signals for confirmation and guidance, not as rigid instructions.

**This type of trader:**

* Has strong technical knowledge
* Spends time studying market structure and patterns
* Uses signals for intuition and trend direction
* Chooses which entry, target, and stop-loss to follow independently

This approach gives advanced traders flexibility to merge their own strategies with our insights.

**💵 Expected Results:**

* Depends on trader’s risk appetite and ability to handle volatility
* 20%–30% profit per month (short-term wallet)
* 100%–200% profit yearly (long-term investment wallet)

### 2️⃣ The Part-Time Trader

If crypto is your side hustle or passion project, this approach fits you best. You might not have deep market knowledge, but with our analysts’ guidance, you can still profit consistently.

**This trader:**

* Relies on analyst signals for direction
* Prioritizes capital safety over high-risk gains
* Focuses on following risk management rules strictly

**💵 Expected Results:**

* 5%–10% profit per month (short-term wallet)
* 50%–100% profit yearly (long-term investment wallet)

With proper discipline, even part-time traders can outperform traditional investments.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

Whether you’re an analyst or a beginner, our **crypto signal channels** are structured to suit your needs. The key is understanding which style works for you and applying it consistently with **discipline and patience**.
