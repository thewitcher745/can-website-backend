## Part 1: Understanding the Impulse and Correction Phases

When we look at the Binance Coin (BNB) weekly chart, we can clearly see the entire price action broken down into distinct market phases — sharp impulse moves followed by prolonged corrections. This rhythmic pattern has defined BNB’s journey since its inception, and understanding it can help traders anticipate what comes next.

### Phase Breakdown: Impulse and Correction Dynamics

On the weekly chart, the entire history of Binance Coin can be segmented into three major impulse phases and two extended correction phases. Each impulse represents a powerful expansion period where the market shows strong bullish momentum, while each correction phase reflects a natural cooling-off or consolidation before the next rally.

### Cycle Breakdown

- **First Impulse (2017–2018):**  
  BNB surged an incredible **+123,789%** within 36 weeks as Binance Exchange gained traction.

- **First Correction (2018–2020):**  
  The price retraced **-83%**, forming a long accumulation base over two years.

- **Second Impulse (2020–2021):**  
  Fueled by Binance Smart Chain and the DeFi boom, BNB rallied another **+11,000%** in about 15 months.

- **Second Correction (2021–2023):**  
  A **-73%** decline followed, forming a broad consolidation amid a bearish market.

- **Current Impulse (2023–Present):**  
  BNB has gained over **+1,700%** so far, suggesting an ongoing expansion phase with potential to target **$3,600–$10,000**, based on past impulse magnitudes.

### The Changing Nature of Each Cycle

A closer examination reveals an important evolution in BNB’s market behavior:

- Early impulses were extremely strong but short-lived, reflecting a young and highly speculative market.  
- Corrections became longer and more complex as liquidity and market participants grew.  
- Recent impulses are slower but more sustainable, indicating that Binance Coin has matured into a long-term asset supported by ecosystem growth rather than hype.  

This pattern suggests that the current impulse phase may take longer to fully develop, but its targets can still reach new all-time highs. A slower yet broader expansion often signals institutional participation and long-term confidence. 

### MACD Indicator: Momentum Still in Favor of Bulls

The MACD indicator at the bottom of the weekly chart adds another layer of confirmation.

- The **MACD line** recently crossed above the signal line, a historically bullish signal that has preceded each major rally in BNB’s history.  
- The **momentum histogram** is rising, yet the indicator still shows room for growth before entering the overbought zone.  
- In previous cycles, BNB continued its upward move for months after such a crossover, suggesting that the current bullish momentum is not yet exhausted.  

This combination of cyclical structure and indicator momentum paints a picture of potential continuation — a developing impulse wave that could extend throughout 2025 and beyond.

### Conclusion for Part 1 

The historical pattern of impulse-correction cycles in Binance Coin highlights a consistent and powerful rhythm in its long-term market structure. Each phase has lasted longer than the last, with reduced volatility and stronger foundational support.  

If this structure repeats, BNB may be entering the most extended impulse phase yet, aiming for higher price levels while taking more time to mature.  

In the next parts of this analysis, we will take a look at the price action from point of view of NEO Wave Analysis that could define BNB’s path toward the next major milestones.

## Part 2: NEO Wave Perspective and Structural Pattern

When we shift our perspective from classical impulse–correction analysis to **NEO Wave theory**, a more advanced and detailed wave structure begins to emerge. On the higher time frames, Binance Coin (BNB) appears to have been evolving inside a large-scale **diametric or symmetric formation** — a rare but significant pattern in NEO Wave analysis.  

This complex structure indicates that BNB’s entire multi-year price movement is unfolding as part of a broad contracting and expanding sequence, which may only become fully clear in the years ahead as additional legs of the pattern reveal themselves.

### Wave Count Breakdown According to NEO Wave Theory

Based on current structural data:

- **Wave A** marked the initial impulsive advance, driving BNB from its inception levels to around $25. This was the foundation phase, fueled by the token’s early adoption and exchange-driven demand.  
- **Wave B** followed as a corrective phase, leading to an extended period of sideways consolidation or range-bound trading — a typical setup for the next leg up.  
- **Wave C** initiated another strong bullish run, continuing the pattern of expansion and taking prices to new highs.  
- **Wave D** emerged as a triangle correction, showcasing tightening volatility and market indecision before the next breakout.  
- **Wave E** seems to have unfolded as an internal A–B–C corrective pattern, completing a larger symmetric cycle.  

Currently, we are likely in the **C-wave of the next higher-degree pattern** — the segment that often delivers the most directional and sustained move of the sequence.

### Projected Targets Based on NEO Wave and Fibonacci Confluence

By applying Fibonacci extension and proportionality rules from NEO Wave theory, potential target zones for this ongoing wave C align between:

- **$3,635** – first key Fibonacci projection  
- **$6,792** – secondary, extended target zone  

These levels correspond with long-term wave symmetry — reinforcing their validity as major future price objectives for BNB if the current structure continues to play out.

### Summary of the NEO Wave Outlook

In summary, the NEO Wave perspective suggests that **Binance Coin is still in the midst of a multi-year structural expansion** within a larger symmetric formation. Although the exact completion of this pattern may take several years, the ongoing wave C phase has strong potential to carry BNB toward significantly higher valuations, consistent with both technical wave theory and Fibonacci alignment.

## Part 3: Wyckoff Re-Accumulation and Breakout Structure

To complete our comprehensive BNB outlook, we now turn to the **Wyckoff theory**, which offers an invaluable framework for understanding market accumulation, distribution, and re-accumulation phases.  

When we zoom into the Binance Coin (BNB) weekly chart through this lens, the structure becomes remarkably clear. The entire price behavior since mid-2021 fits perfectly within a **re-accumulation schematic**, suggesting that the market has been preparing for its next major uptrend.

### Re-Accumulation Phase: Mid 2021 – Mid 2024

Following the 2021 market peak, BNB entered a broad consolidation phase beginning around June 2021. This three-year period represented a classic re-accumulation zone — a time when institutional buyers and strong hands quietly absorbed supply while retail sentiment remained neutral or bearish.  

Throughout this period:

- The market experienced wide swings, representing phases of testing, shaking out weak holders, and rebuilding support.  
- This structure lasted until mid-2024, forming a stable base for renewed expansion.

### Breakout and SOS Phase: Mid 2024 – 2025

In **July 2024**, BNB successfully broke out of its re-accumulation range by completing the **S (Spring)** and **LPS (Last Point of Support)** stages. This breakout confirmed the start of the **SOS (Sign of Strength)** phase — a period marked by higher highs, rising volume, and strong continuation patterns.  

Throughout 2025, BNB has remained within this SOS expansion, steadily climbing and showing clear dominance over prior resistance levels. According to Wyckoff principles, this phase often precedes the **final markup stage**, where price accelerates toward new highs.

### Upcoming Pullback: The Last Opportunity Zone

With the SOS phase nearing completion, the chart suggests that a short-term pullback may occur before the next impulsive advance begins.  

This potential retest or “last opportunity” (LPS) zone is projected between:

- **$1,094 – $970**  

This range could represent the final accumulation opportunity for BNB before it transitions into the next major markup phase. A healthy correction here would allow new buyers to enter, re-confirm support, and fuel the next upward move.

### BNB Target Levels Based on Wyckoff and Technical Confluence

Once the pullback completes, three major target zones emerge from the Wyckoff and Fibonacci confluence structure:

1. **$1,573** – Initial breakout confirmation level  
2. **$2,116** – Mid-term structural resistance and momentum target  
3. **$3,632** – Long-term Fibonacci and Wyckoff projection zone  

Reaching these levels would align perfectly with the larger impulse structure discussed in Parts 1 and 2, confirming the synchronized nature of BNB’s long-term cycle across multiple analytical frameworks.

## Final Thoughts

The Wyckoff re-accumulation model strengthens the broader technical narrative: **BNB has spent years building a solid foundation for its next expansion.**

- The multi-year accumulation (2021–2024) has now transitioned into a clear SOS phase.  
- The pullback toward **$1,094–$970** may be the final chance for strategic accumulation.  
- Once complete, BNB could unlock its next growth cycle, potentially making new all-time highs.  


By combining insights from **classical impulse-correction analysis**, **NEO Wave theory**, and **Wyckoff accumulation**, this full study presents a unified outlook — one that points toward a strong and sustainable bull phase for Binance Coin in the near future ahead.
