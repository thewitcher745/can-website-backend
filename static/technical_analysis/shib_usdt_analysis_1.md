Like most memecoins, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has undergone a significant correction in recent weeks. This retracement has brought the SHIBUSDT price closer to its critical buy zone, located near the end of wave (C).

This area is drawing attention from traders and investors alike, as it could provide a second entry opportunity before a possible bullish reversal.

Critical Buy Zone to Watch ðŸŽ¯

The buy zone highlighted on the SHIBUSDT 3D chart represents a key accumulation area. If price action stabilizes here with clear signs of demand, it may indicate that buyers are stepping back in to prepare for the next upward move.

Patience is key â€” waiting for confirmation from this zone could improve the risk-to-reward ratio for both short-term traders and long-term holders.

Potential Trend Reversal Ahead ðŸš€

Once buy orders are triggered and momentum builds, traders should look for a break above the main trendline. This breakout would confirm a new bullish wave, potentially targeting three major resistance zones identified in the analysis.

A clean move above that level could shift Shiba Inuâ€™s market sentiment and mark the beginning of its next growth phase.
