Alien Worlds (TLMUSDT) is approaching a decisive support zone on the daily chart. After the recent correction, price may revisit this level for a third touch, which could spark a major retracement upward. However, traders must also be prepared for the possibility of a sweep below support before any meaningful recovery.

ðŸ“Š **Market Overview:**  
The chart highlights the main support line that has already proven its significance earlier this year. A third touch would reinforce its importance, making it a potential springboard for a bullish retracement.  

ðŸª™ **Trading Plan:**  
Caution is essential. While the setup offers upside potential, the risk of a stop-loss sweep below the support remains. Conservative position sizing is recommended to minimize impact if the support fails.
