---

Ethena (ENA) appears to be in its distribution phase, with the final legâ€”UTAD (Upthrust After Distribution)â€”likely forming soon. This move could take shape either as a rejection at the highlighted resistance zone or as a liquidity grab above previous highs. Traders should carefully observe market reactions before confirming the direction.

ðŸ”Ž **Market Insight**  
The distribution structure is nearing completion, and price action around resistance will determine whether ENA enters weakness or extends higher temporarily.  

ðŸ“Š **Trading Strategy**  
Monitoring the highlighted resistance zone is key. Once UTAD completes, profit-taking opportunities may arise during the SOW (Sign of Weakness) as price revisits support.

ðŸ“Œ **Update**  
ENAUSDT confirmed the expected Upthrust After Distribution, dropping ~11% from the resistance zone.  

ðŸ“Š **Outlook**  
With price entering the final stages of the distribution phase, further swing highs and lows are likely before reaching the ultimate buy zone. Short-term traders can use this roadmap for scalp opportunities on lower timeframes until accumulation levels are reached.

ðŸª™ **Profit Update**  
The roadmap played out precisely, with short positions from the top already yielding 16% profit. Since price has reached a technical zone that could spark retracements, partial profit-taking here can secure trades and reduce risk.

ðŸ”Ž **Update**  
After a 34% correction, ENAUSDT found support at the first key level, forming a sign-of-weakness (SOW) range.  

ðŸ“Š **Outlook**  
Two possible scenarios remain before continuation, with potential retracement still in play. The highlighted rebuy zone is where profits from shorts can be locked in and new long positions considered.
