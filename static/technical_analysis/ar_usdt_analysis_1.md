On the ARUSDT weekly chart, price is struggling beneath the highlighted descending trendline. Until the market absorbs selling pressure, significant bullish momentum is unlikely.

Traders should note that consolidation near trendlines often precedes a more substantial move once lower support levels attract enough buying activity.

## Key Support Zones & Trading Scenarios 🔝

We’ve identified two main scenarios for planning trades:

Support Bounce – Price tests lower support, gathers buyers, and attempts a breakout above the descending trendline.

Deeper Correction – Price dips further to the secondary support line before reversal momentum builds.

Careful observation of candlestick reactions and volume at these zones can provide reliable signals for entry and risk management.
