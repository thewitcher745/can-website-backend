üöÄ **Performance Update**

ü™ô **Accumulation Signal**  
Solana is up 50% with strong buying pressure. With $180 now acting as support and a confirmed LPS, even potential pullbacks would likely present new buying opportunities.

üîé **Correction Watch**  
Price touched the support zone but has yet to show strong momentum. A reclaim of last week‚Äôs red candle would boost bullish continuation. Otherwise, market makers may attempt a fake breakdown before resuming the uptrend.

üí° **Pullback in Play**

üöÄ **Trend Continuation**  
Solana has climbed steadily over 40% since the entry zone. Price is nearing a key resistance level ‚Äî reactions here will reveal whether rejection or a breakout occurs. Profit-taking at this zone is logical while preparing to re-enter after wave (B) pullback.

üìå **Correction Phase**  
A 20% retracement has unfolded, confirming wave B is in play. The next bullish impulse (wave C) requires a sharp reversal for momentum to sustain. Until then, accumulation near the highlighted box remains the focus for positioning.
