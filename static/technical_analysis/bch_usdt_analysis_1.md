The price action of **Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSDT)** on the 3-day chart is approaching a critical juncture, where the market must soon decide its next major move. Traders are carefully monitoring both bullish and bearish scenarios that could define the mid-term roadmap.

## Bullish Scenario: Retracement to Previous Highs

There is a possibility that BCH will attempt a retracement toward its previous highs established in 2024. If buyers step in, this move could grab liquidity sitting above these resistance levels and potentially pave the way for further continuation. Such a setup would likely attract momentum traders looking for breakout confirmation.

## Bearish Scenario: Breaking the Trendline Support levels

On the other hand, BCH is also hovering dangerously close to losing its key trendline support. A confirmed breakdown here could trigger a correction toward deeper support levels, opening the door for a bearish extension. This path would likely flush out weak hands before any stronger recovery attempt.

## Trading Opportunities Ahead

Both the bullish retracement and bearish correction paths create potential opportunities. However, traders should be cautious and wait for **clear confirmation signals** before entering positions. Patience and risk management will be essential, as false breakouts and liquidity traps are common in such setups.

📊 Whether BCH chooses the path of strength or correction, staying updated on key levels and price reactions is crucial.
