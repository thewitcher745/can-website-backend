If you're planning to buy into memecoins, it’s still too early to rush in. The chart suggests that price can move even lower 📉. Popcat, for example, has room for another dip 🪂.

## We currently have two possible paths: 
a visit to the support just below last night’s low, or a sweep of liquidity under October’s level. In both cases, sticking to safer support zones is the smarter approach. These areas align better with sound technical analysis and give cleaner signals for low-risk entries 💡.

Hopefully you stayed patient and avoided buying too early 😏. Price dipped exactly as expected and has now bounced with a strong 65% recovery after tapping our support zone 📌.

The roadmap remains clear and fully valid. As price continues upward, it’s smarter to secure at least 50% at TP1 before the main descending trendline is challenged 👛. This keeps you aligned with the market structure while respecting healthy price action and technical analysis levels.
