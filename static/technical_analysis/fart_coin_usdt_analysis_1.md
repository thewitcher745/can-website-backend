desc: "FARTCOIN came close to retesting its all-time high (ATH) back in mid-August, but as structure shows, that move was part of a corrective retracement within a much larger ABC pattern. Let’s break down the current roadmap and what to expect next."

---
The rally toward ATH was actually wave B of an inner ABC move, nested inside a broader ABC correction. This layered structure indicates that the current market move is still in correction mode, not yet a full breakout phase.

## Revisiting Support Before a Rebound

With this pattern in play, it’s very possible that FARTCOIN will revisit its previously tested support zone — the same level tapped during the recent liquidation event. This retest would allow the market to absorb liquidity and gather the buying strength needed for another upward push.

## 🔝 Next Target Outlook

Once sufficient buyers reload at those lower zones, a new attempt toward ATH becomes much more likely. Patience and staged entries near support could offer strong setups for the next bullish leg. 🚀

After a sharp 50% correction, price has finally reached the main support zone, where buyers are starting to step in and hold the level. 🟢

Now the focus is on how deep price moves inside this support box before wave C completes and a new bullish move can begin. ☄️🔜
