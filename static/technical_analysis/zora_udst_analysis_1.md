desc: "ZORAUSDT is forming a classic triangle setup, and traders are watching closely for a possible breakout. This analysis breaks down both bullish and bearish scenarios, key support and resistance zones, and how to plan entries with precision."

The ZORAUSDT 1-hour chart is showing a well-defined triangle pattern, suggesting that the market is consolidating before its next big move. Currently, price action appears to be finalizing wave (e). the last phase before a potential breakout to the downside. ☄️

## Key Scenarios to Watch:

Since wave (e) might still need more time to complete, there are two possible entry setups to keep an eye on:

A small upward move to finalize wave (e) before a reversal.

A direct breakdown from the triangle structure without retesting the upper trendline.

Both scenarios lean toward a bearish continuation, but traders should wait for confirmation signals such as volume spikes or strong rejection candles before entering. 🔜

## Trading Plan and Target Zones:

There are three target levels highlighted on the chart, each representing a potential reaction zone for traders. The key strategy here is to set layered entries and exits to cover both the black and red scenarios while maintaining strong risk management. 🚩

## Outlook for ZORAUSDT:

If this pattern plays out, ZORAUSDT could offer one of the cleaner short setups in the market. Watching for a confirmed breakout and retest could give traders the edge in catching the next major move. Stay alert and ready for volatility. ⚡

The triangle pattern has now evolved into a symmetrical formation, and our previous call of a 14% correction was accurate. 🔴

The highlighted zone remains a strong area to book profits and prepare for a potential upward retracement leg. 🌐

⚠️ As always, apply strict risk management at each technical level to protect positions and maximize gains. ✔️

🔴 Short Scalp: TP1 Reached 🔴

The symmetrical pattern is playing out as expected, with the final wave delivering 19% profit so far. ✔️

Traders booking partial profits at TP1 should now watch the highlighted lower support zones, which may mark the end of wave (i) and provide the next opportunity for entries. 📌

The chart remains perfectly aligned with the market trend, as we track the end of wave (i) with precision. 🎯

💰 Smart move: Take 80% of profits now and monitor the next move closely. Pay attention — will the support hold, or are we heading toward TP2 soon? 😠
