Quant Coin has been slowly drifting inside wave (B) of its larger ABC corrective structure, showing controlled downside movement over the past couple of weeks. 🕯
This slow pressure indicates a buildup phase before a possible shift in momentum.

## 📈 Breakout Signal Potential: (Trading Signal)

There’s now a realistic chance of seeing a breakout above the descending trendline, which would likely confirm the start of wave (C). 🪧
A clean breakout + retest would act as a strong long signal for bullish continuation.

## 🛡 Pullback Zone & Confirmation Plan: (Crypto Roadmap)

If the breakout occurs, the highlighted pullback zone becomes a backup support area, ideal for safe entries only after a confirmed reaction. 👀
## Dont forget: 
**No confirmation = no entry**
 Patience protects capital. ✅
