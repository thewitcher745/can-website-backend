## Triangle Pattern and Technical Structure 🔺

Multiple touches on both trendlines confirm a strong symmetrical triangle, while decreasing volume supports the idea of a tightening range. This technical setup often precedes a sharp price movement. With wave (c) expected to follow once a confirmed breakout occurs. 📈

## Breakout Setup and Wave (C) Projection 💪

A confirmed breakout above the triangle’s upper boundary would likely mark the start of wave (c), targeting higher resistance levels. Momentum indicators such as RSI and MACD show early signs of bullish divergence, suggesting growing strength among buyers.

## Entry Zone and Trading Strategy 🎯

Traders should remain patient and wait for the inner leg of wave (b) to complete before entering. The highlighted pullback zone presents the most strategic entry opportunity, offering a favorable risk–reward ratio before the anticipated breakout. Watching for volume expansion at breakout confirmation will be key. 💼

The AI16ZUSDT chart is approaching a decisive technical moment. As wave (b) nears completion, a successful breakout could confirm the start of wave (c), opening the path to new local highs. Traders should stay focused on confirmation candles and volume shifts before entering. 🌟
