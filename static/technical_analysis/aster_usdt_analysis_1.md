desc: "This analysis covers the current ASTERUSDT market structure, highlighting its bearish Distribution phase, signs of weakness, potential Selling Climax, and short-term trading scenarios for active traders. 📊"

---

Aster is deep inside a Distribution phase, and with a clear SOW (Sign of Weakness) already visible, momentum is shifting strongly to the downside. This increases the probability of further decline as sellers maintain control. 🔴

## 📉 Selling Climax (SC) Expectations:

Given the weakness, a new SC (Selling Climax) may soon unfold, pushing price into deeper support zones. This aligns with the broader bearish ASTERUSDT trend and suggests caution for long-term buyers. 🔽

## 🎯 Lower Timeframe Trading Scenarios:

Although the dominant direction is bearish, several short-term scenarios are highlighted on the chart. These may offer scalp or intraday opportunities, but only with:

**✅ Proper triggers**
**✅ Strong confirmation**
**✅ Strict risk management**

No blind entries. 📌

Price has followed the roadmap cleanly, delivering a 25% correction on the way down. ☄️

The overall bearish plan remains valid, and price may soon begin its second swing low to complete the Selling Climax (SC). 🔜

Final targets lie inside the highlighted buy zone, but partial profits on the way down are still the smart approach. 👛

Yesterday’s pump attempt driven by market manipulation failed to hold above the trendline after breaking out of the wedge. ⛔
With this breakdown confirmed, the buy zone is adjusted lower, expecting the Re-Distribution phase to drag price further down. ⚠️
Smart traders stay adaptive. **precision over hope.** 💡
