Many traders weren’t able to catch the earlier move, but the current chart structure suggests another opportunity forming. 💱 Based on our technical analysis, the preferred scenario is the black path, as it aligns with a more bullish trend and stronger upside signals. This scenario supports continued market momentum and a healthier price action outlook. ✅

Market makers essentially gave us a second chance to accumulate before driving price all the way to Target 1. ⚡️ The roadmap remains valid, and price is now approaching the highlighted descending trendline, which is the next key signal. 🔜

If this trendline breaks with strong momentum, higher targets on this wave could unlock and push the market further upward. 🔓📈
