Ripple (XRP) is currently consolidating within a critical support zone. While the anticipated "Spring" move has yet to materialize, bearish sentiment in the market increases the likelihood of a sharp liquidity event forming this spring phase before re-accumulation. Once complete, traders will be watching closely for the SOS (Sign of Strength) to confirm recovery potential.
