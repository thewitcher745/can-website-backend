A more pessimistic scenario is still on the table for NKN on the weekly chart. 🧐
Based on our current technical analysis, the latest dip may only represent the first leg of a 3-drive pattern, meaning the chart could retest deeper support levels before offering any reliable Signals for major entries. 📉

If this structure plays out, waiting for lower zones to be tested can help traders spot cleaner setups and stronger confirmations. Patience is key, especially when the broader trend still leans bearish. 🔍

Price pushed upward, tapped the resistance line, and got rejected exactly as expected giving us over a 50% corrective move to complete the second drive of the 3-drive pattern. 💯

Each support zone can trigger a technical reaction, but it’s important to drill into lower timeframes to find a clean trading setup before acting. 📌

Price has already touched the main support once and delivered a strong 190% reaction. ⚡️

Still, with overall market sentiment leaning bearish, there’s a chance we revisit the buy zones again before wave (C) officially begins. 🔄
