desc: "EigenLayer (EIGEN) is showing a sharp breakout from its previous consolidation, signaling potential trading opportunities in the coming days. This analysis highlights key zones and price structures to watch for both retracements and trend continuation."

---
The EIGENUSDT daily chart suggests that the previous ranging zone formed a symmetrical pattern. Price has now broken out sharply, which may mark the start of wave A in a new upward sequence.

This breakout indicates renewed bullish momentum, but as with any post-breakout scenario, a corrective pullback is likely before the trend fully develops.

## Retracement & Wave B Potential ðŸ”œ

After the initial surge, a pullback is expected, representing wave B. This retracement could offer a secondary entry point for traders looking to capitalize on the next leg upward. Monitoring price action around key support and resistance levels will be critical to identify the optimal re-entry zones.

## Highlighted Technical Zones ðŸ“Œ

All highlighted zones on the chart represent significant technical areas where price tends to react. These include support, resistance, and pivot points that can provide high-probability trading setups if approached carefully.

Traders should watch these zones for volume spikes, rejection patterns, or confirmation candlesticks before placing orders.
