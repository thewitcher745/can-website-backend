desc: "EigenLayer (EIGEN) is showing a sharp breakout from its previous consolidation, signaling potential trading opportunities in the coming days. This analysis highlights key zones and price structures to watch for both retracements and trend continuation."

---
The EIGENUSDT daily chart suggests that the previous ranging zone formed a symmetrical pattern. Price has now broken out sharply, which may mark the start of wave A in a new upward sequence.

This breakout indicates renewed bullish momentum, but as with any post-breakout scenario, a corrective pullback is likely before the trend fully develops.

## Retracement & Wave B Potential 🔜

After the initial surge, a pullback is expected, representing wave B. This retracement could offer a secondary entry point for traders looking to capitalize on the next leg upward. Monitoring price action around key support and resistance levels will be critical to identify the optimal re-entry zones.

## Highlighted Technical Zones 📌

All highlighted zones on the chart represent significant technical areas where price tends to react. These include support, resistance, and pivot points that can provide high-probability trading setups if approached carefully.

Traders should watch these zones for volume spikes, rejection patterns, or confirmation candlesticks before placing orders.

## 🔴 Dump into buy zone: 49%
## 🟢 Recovery from buy zone: 13.25%

Wave C played out exactly as expected, tapping our support zone before turning upward and starting wave D 🔄. The chart structure and current price action still keep this box valid, meaning any dips back into this area can offer a solid buying opportunity.

With two potential market scenarios ahead, entries inside this zone allow us to position for the next move as wave D develops keeping an eye on signals, trend, and key resistance levels. ✔️
