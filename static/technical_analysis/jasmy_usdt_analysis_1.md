JASMY (JASMYUSDT) has struggled since the end of 2024, with 2025 price action largely contained within wave B of a larger ABC correction. This pattern suggests a potential continuation toward lower levels before a safe accumulation zone emerges.

💡 **Market Insight**  
The coin is currently in the corrective wave B, providing a setup that favors patient traders. Wave C may offer selling opportunities for experienced traders, but caution is recommended for less seasoned participants.  

📊 **Trading Strategy**  
For non-professional traders, waiting for the highlighted buy zone at the end of the ABC pattern is the safest approach. Observing confirmation signals at this level can provide a higher probability entry while minimizing risk.

## 📊 Performance snapshot:

If you followed our sell signals, wave C closed out your target profits were met. After touching our buy zone, JASMY has recovered over 100%, so traders who re-entered early are in a strong position. 🛍

## 🔁 Two pullback scenarios to watch

Mid-shadow buy. add into the middle of the wick left by the sell-off (aggressive entry).

Revisit initial support. wait for price to test our original buy zone again (safer entry). 🧲

## 🧭 Plan of action

We’ll take it step-by-step: watch how price behaves around the shadow and the initial support, then decide which scenario confirms first before adding size. Stay focused on price structure and volume for the confirmation. ⌛
