desc: "This analysis focuses on the current UBUSDT market structure, wave progression, key support levels, and potential trading opportunities. We’ll break down what wave (c) suggests, where downside pressure may accelerate, and how wave (d) could offer a strategic buying zone. 📊"

Price is currently moving inside wave (c), with expectations for this wave to complete at the highlighted resistance zone. A strong rejection here is crucial to confirm downside continuation and validate the bearish structure. ⚠️
This aligns with the broader UBUSDT price analysis and corrective roadmap.

## 📉 Red Support Zone & Breakdown Scenario:

If the red support zone fails to hold, the market may continue lower. A breakdown would signal the completion of wave (c) and open the door to a wave (d) buying opportunity, aligning with the corrective structure of this setup. 🛒

## 🎯 Wave (d) Buy Zone Opportunity:

Should price reach the projected wave (d) level, this could mark a high-probability accumulation zone, offering long setups for the next impulsive move. This aligns with crypto retracement strategy and support-based entries. ✅

## Dont forget the following Risk Management rules:

 1- Strict risk management
 2- Clear price-action triggers
 3- Confirmed rejection or breakout signals

Price has delivered nearly 40% downside correction since rejecting the highlighted zone. Hope you locked in profits on the way down. ☄️

With the second retracement complete, focus now shifts to the wave (d) buy zone, where the next opportunity may form. 📉

💡 Smart Plan:
✅ Close all short positions at the highlighted zone
✅ Prepare fresh longs for wave (e) with three upside targets ahead 🚀
