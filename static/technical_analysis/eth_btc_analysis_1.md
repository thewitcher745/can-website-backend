**Recovery in Motion – Is Ethereum Preparing for a Turn Against Bitcoin?**

Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin remains under pressure as the ETHBTC index extends its corrective leg. After a 16% decline, the pair appears to be approaching the lower boundary of wave D, where potential signs of accumulation could emerge. Traders are watching closely to anticipate when altcoins might regain strength versus BTC.

💡 **Market Outlook**  
ETH continues to show a slowdown in momentum relative to BTC, with the current correction suggesting there’s still room to the downside before completing wave D. Minor swing lows and highs along the path may act as liquidity traps, but the broader structure remains intact, hinting that a larger trend shift could follow once this phase concludes.  

📊 **Trading Setup**  
Traders should remain patient while monitoring for potential exhaustion near the end of wave D. Any confirmed reversal signals from that region could present medium-term opportunities for ETH to recover strength against Bitcoin. For now, caution and focus on the bigger picture remain key.

🔎 **Technical Update**  
ETHBTC continues to mirror the projected path toward the lower end of wave D, maintaining a cautious tone as Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin’s momentum.  

📌 **Outlook**  
Minor price fluctuations may occur as liquidity is gathered on the way down, but the overall structure still supports the potential for a recovery phase once this corrective leg completes. Traders are advised to stay focused on the macro structure for positioning ahead of the next major move.

📉 **Correction from Top**: -22%
📈 **Recovery from Support**: +13%

The ETH/BTC pair continues to show a bearish structure, currently moving midway through wave D of its broader corrective phase.

As it stands, the price action suggests a possible continuation toward lower support levels, with the next targets sitting between two key zones — and potentially even the bottom of the second support line. ⚠️

However, everything now depends on how Ethereum reacts to the highlighted orange zone. A strong rejection here could trigger deeper correction on Ethereum and its children, while a weak one may open the path for sooner recovery movement. 👀
