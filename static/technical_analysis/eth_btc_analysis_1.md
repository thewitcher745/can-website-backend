**Recovery in Motion â€“ Is Ethereum Preparing for a Turn Against Bitcoin?**

Ethereumâ€™s performance against Bitcoin remains under pressure as the ETHBTC index extends its corrective leg. After a 16% decline, the pair appears to be approaching the lower boundary of wave D, where potential signs of accumulation could emerge. Traders are watching closely to anticipate when altcoins might regain strength versus BTC.

ðŸ’¡ **Market Outlook**  
ETH continues to show a slowdown in momentum relative to BTC, with the current correction suggesting thereâ€™s still room to the downside before completing wave D. Minor swing lows and highs along the path may act as liquidity traps, but the broader structure remains intact, hinting that a larger trend shift could follow once this phase concludes.  

ðŸ“Š **Trading Setup**  
Traders should remain patient while monitoring for potential exhaustion near the end of wave D. Any confirmed reversal signals from that region could present medium-term opportunities for ETH to recover strength against Bitcoin. For now, caution and focus on the bigger picture remain key.
