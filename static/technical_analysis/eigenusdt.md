EIGEN recently completed a strong 60% rally into wave E and is now entering a corrective phase. Price has already started moving down from the highlighted resistance zone toward wave F, showing early signs of weakness. This phase offers opportunities for traders to manage risk while planning the next move.

ðŸ’¡ **Market Insight**  
After finishing wave E, EIGEN entered a corrective wave, currently reflecting around a 16% decline. This suggests a healthy retracement within the broader market structure and provides clear checkpoints for traders.  

ðŸ“Œ **Trading Strategy**  
With the move halfway toward wave F, traders may consider securing partial profits on short positions to lock in gains and reduce exposure. Full profit-taking is expected near the bottom of wave F. Depending on the reaction at that level, the market may either continue with a short leg G or extend into a longer corrective structure.
