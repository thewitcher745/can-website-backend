The LPTUSDT weekly chart shows that Livepeer has entered a complex wave C correction. Price action indicates that the market is undergoing a deeper retracement, which is typical after extended bullish phases.

Traders and investors should be cautious, as early entries may carry higher risk until a clear support zone confirms a reversal.

## Key Technical Levels to Watch üìå

We have identified two critical levels that could guide the continuation of this downward move:

First support zone ‚Äì where initial buying interest may appear, potentially slowing the decline.

Second lower level ‚Äì a more decisive area that may determine whether wave C completes before any rebound occurs.

Monitoring price behavior and candle patterns around these levels is essential for spotting trading opportunities while minimizing risk.

Hope you listened to our warning as we told you things were not looking good for #Livepeer. ‚ö†Ô∏è

After 72% correction in the recent crash, we are still waiting for #LPT to reach our safe entry zone to finish wave (C) and finally start a nice rally to challenge its old descending trendline. üîù
