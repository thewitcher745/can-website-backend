When we zoom out on this chart, it becomes clear that the bullish momentum across the crypto market was driven by wave (B) in Tether Dominance, which allowed money to flow back into alts 📉.

The sharp breakout we recently saw suggests that wave (C) may have finally begun 🔝. Inside wave (C), we’re likely dealing with another ABC structure, so the goal now is to pinpoint where this bullish leg could complete before the market shifts again toward recovery in altcoins 🔜.

Each highlighted support and resistance zone is critical, That's how the price action reacts there can turn everything green or red very quickly 🟢🔴.

We’ve seen nearly 12% growth on this index, perfectly in line with our original analysis ⚡️. Now the focus is on identifying where the next swing low might form ⁉️

**There are two possible market scenarios:**
  – A rejection right at the previous high
  – Or a push above it to grab liquidity before turning

Either way, the highlighted resistance zone is a logical place for a reaction, which could allow the crypto market to breathe and recover. ➕

## 📤 Increase since pullback: 17.75%
## 📥 Rejection from zone: 9.08%

Tether Dominance remains a key indicator showing where money is moving within the crypto market 📈. With alts beginning to recover, we need to watch closely asz wave B may be nearing completion ⚠️.

Both the top and bottom of the highlighted box are important support and resistance areas. Price reactions inside this zone will give us clear signals about the next trend, so keep an eye on it 👀.

## 📤 Reaction to box: 6.02%

The market reacted exactly as expected, with Tether Dominance bouncing cleanly from our support box and climbing more than 6% so far 🔄. The price action confirms that our analysis and roadmap are still on track.

That said, momentum isn’t strong enough yet to confirm a full bullish leg, so there’s still a chance this index dips back into the box for another go ⚠️. Keep an eye on how the market behaves there and it will offer clearer signals for the next move.

## ↗️ Pattern Continuation: 13.60%

Wave C has pushed this index straight into the first target with nearly 14% upside, exactly as projected. ⚡️
Now we watch to see whether a reaction forms here: A pause or pullback would make sense at this stage. ⁉️

If bears take profits around this level, a swing low could appear before the index continues higher, which would give alts some room to recover. ➕

Tether Dominance has surged to the top just as outlined in the initial analysis, and momentum now shows that wave (F) of this diametric pattern is nearing completion. ⏱

Once a correction begins, two potential wave (G) scenarios come into play:

## 🥇 Shortened Wave (G):
A sharp mid-way reversal would trigger a heavy crash across the crypto market.

## 🥈 Extended Wave (G):
This would send the index all the way back to the previous bottom, the setup that typically triggers a full altseason. ✨

Our main roadmap favors the second scenario, but staying aware of both paths keeps us prepared and cautious. 🏃
