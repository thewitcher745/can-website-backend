When we zoom out on this chart, it becomes clear that the bullish momentum across the crypto market was driven by wave (B) in Tether Dominance, which allowed money to flow back into alts 📉.

The sharp breakout we recently saw suggests that wave (C) may have finally begun 🔝. Inside wave (C), we’re likely dealing with another ABC structure, so the goal now is to pinpoint where this bullish leg could complete before the market shifts again toward recovery in altcoins 🔜.

Each highlighted support and resistance zone is critical, That's how the price action reacts there can turn everything green or red very quickly 🟢🔴.

We’ve seen nearly 12% growth on this index, perfectly in line with our original analysis ⚡️. Now the focus is on identifying where the next swing low might form ⁉️

**There are two possible market scenarios:**
  – A rejection right at the previous high
  – Or a push above it to grab liquidity before turning

Either way, the highlighted resistance zone is a logical place for a reaction, which could allow the crypto market to breathe and recover. ➕

## 📤 Reaction to box: 6.02%

The market reacted exactly as expected, with Tether Dominance bouncing cleanly from our support box and climbing more than 6% so far 🔄. The price action confirms that our analysis and roadmap are still on track.

That said, momentum isn’t strong enough yet to confirm a full bullish leg, so there’s still a chance this index dips back into the box for another go ⚠️. Keep an eye on how the market behaves there and it will offer clearer signals for the next move.
