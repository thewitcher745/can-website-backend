ENJ confirmed the completion of its ABC corrective wave and delivered a sharp recovery move â€” rallying over 65% from the identified monthly support zone.  

ðŸª™ Insight: Partial profit-taking is recommended as the asset extends higher. Traders who missed the initial entry may still look for re-entries near the established support if price revisits this zone.

The roadmap has unfolded as projected â€” ENJ delivered a 90% recovery, followed by a healthy 40% retracement.  

ðŸ“Š Strategy Update: The monthly support remains our prime accumulation area. Strong buying interest here could pave the way for another substantial recovery move in the upcoming cycle.

After a 50% correction, ENJ has finally revisited its monthly support zone, aligning with prior analysis. Market sentiment, however, remains bearish across the board.  

ðŸ”Ž Trading Outlook: Instead of rushing to accumulate, patience is crucial. Allowing the price to penetrate deeper into support could help flush out weak hands and excessive leverage.  

ðŸ“Œ Forward Plan: A gradual DCA approach within the highlighted support zone may prove effective for building strong spot positions ahead of a potential breakout at the conclusion of wave C.
