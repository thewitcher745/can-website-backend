Market makers appear to have maintained control over volatility, gradually slowing momentum and shaping a complex corrective phase. This controlled structure indicates preparation for the final leg of the ABC corrective pattern. 🟢

## Wave Structure and Pattern Analysis 📈

The ongoing formation of wave B continues to align with the classic ABC correction model, where accumulation may occur near the lower boundary of the structure. Technical indicators suggest the market is approaching an exhaustion phase, supporting the idea that wave B could soon find its bottom.

## Key Support Zones and Reversal Potential 📌

Two crucial support zones are highlighted on the chart, both areas hold strong potential for identifying the end of wave B. A reaction from either zone could trigger the beginning of wave C, marking a new bullish impulse phase. Traders should monitor these levels for early signs of reversal confirmation and volume expansion.

## MYROUSDT Outlook and Trading Insight 🧭

The MYROUSDT 3D chart shows clear corrective movement under controlled market conditions. Once wave B completes near the key support zones, the market could be poised for a strong recovery. Patience remains essential. waiting for confirmation from price action or trend indicators will help identify the safest entry opportunities. ⚡

Inner wave movements are unfolding perfectly, delivering a sharp +30% growth right after touching our key support zone. 🔄 As price now approaches the highlighted resistance line, traders are advised to book partial profits and observe how the market reacts. 💱 This will confirm whether MYROUSDT continues along the larger bullish roadmap or shifts into a new trend phase. 📊

After an impressive +90% rally, MYROUSDT faced a strong rejection from the technical resistance zone, dropping nearly 40%, exactly as projected on our chart. 📉 Hopefully, traders secured profits and avoided buying near the top. 🙂

At the moment, this coin isn’t viable for new investment unless price retraces toward the lower support zones. ⚠️ The end of wave B remains the ideal area to consider adding MYRO back into meme coin portfolios. 🫴

Hope you didn’t get trapped in the recent **memecoin** pullback, especially **MYRO**, as we warned earlier about price diving lower to collect liquidity at the end of wave B. ☄️

Since then, MYROUSDT has made an incredible 100% recovery, now approaching TP1. ✔️ Traders currently in this position should book partial profits, as the next move depends on whether price can break above the main resistance zone at TP1 or face another short-term rejection. ⁉️
