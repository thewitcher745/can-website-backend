desc: "In this FILUSDT analysis we examine the 2-hour chart structure: price is currently stuck in a large accumulation phase, and market makers may attempt a minor Sign of Strength (mSOS) to shake out weak longs. This write-up explains the likely trap scenario, the rejection setup to watch for, and the high-probability long entry (end of S / Spring) to consider once price confirms rejection."

**FILUSDT** is range-bound inside a broad accumulation box on the 2H chart, showing low volatility and compressed price action. That environment usually precedes a liquidity hunt or a final shakeout before a larger directional move. Keep an eye on range extremes and volume behavior for clues. 📊

## Minor Sign of Strength (Trap Risk) ⚠️

A likely scenario is an upward pop (mSOS) that clears a few local highs — a textbook liquidity grab. That move can look bullish on lower timeframes but often functions as a fake breakout designed to trap late buyers. If volume spikes on the pop but quickly fades, treat the move with suspicion. 👎

## Rejection & Spring Setup (Long Opportunity) 📌

If the mSOS is rejected and price falls back into the range, the end of S (Spring) could mark an attractive long entry. Look for a clean rejection candle, support hold in the lower accumulation band, and confirmation via volume increase on the subsequent bounce before committing size. This gives a better risk–reward than buying the initial fake breakout. 🎯

## Trading Plan & Risk Management 🛡️

Plan two plays: (1) avoid chasing the mSOS upward, treat it as a potential trap; (2) prepare to buy the validated Spring (end of S) with tight stops below the demand zone. Use position sizing and take partial profits as price confirms a genuine breakout. Watching momentum and volume is essential. ✔️

FILUSDT remains in accumulation. Expect a possible fake breakout (mSOS) followed by a rejection that could offer a high-quality long at the Spring. Patience and confirmation are your friends, wait for rejection + volume confirmation before entering. 🚀
