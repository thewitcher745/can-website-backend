We’re looking at two potential scenarios on this chart right now:

## 🥇 Scenario 1:
Price may hold its current momentum and continue pushing upward from this zone. If that happens, the pullback along the blue line becomes a solid area to buy, supported by clean price action and reliable signals.

## 🥈 Scenario 2:
A deeper pullback could form as the market gathers more buyers before moving higher again. This aligns well with classic technical analysis and offers a safer entry for traders who prefer reduced risks.

Depending on your risk appetite, you can take quick scalp positions on lower timeframes or wait for confirmation near stronger supported  areas 💡

**🔼 Long scalp TP1 hit: 14.89%**

Price followed our second scenario perfectly, giving us a clean pullback into support and delivering nearly 15% profit 🚀. In a bloody market, this kind of precision is gold.

Since the move played out smoothly, it’s wise not to get greedy and book half of the position and make the trade risk-free 🪙.

We’ll hold the remaining portion for higher targets as wave C continues developing, watching the trend and price action for the next signals. 🚀

We secured a **15% profit** at TP1 in the previous insight and are now set for the next move. 🔄
Price could either continue upward  or pull back  to complete wave (b). 🧐
Each path provides a unique trading opportunity for those applying proper risk management. ❗️
