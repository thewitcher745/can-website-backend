The TRBUSDT weekly chart indicates that Tron could retest lower support levels before showing signs of a sustained rebound. These corrections are common in altcoins following broader market volatility and provide opportunities for strategic accumulation.

## Highlighted Support Zones ⚠️

We’ve identified two main support lines that could act as buffers against selling pressure. Monitoring these zones is crucial:

They represent potential buying opportunities for swing traders

They help assess if the market is stabilizing for a possible upward move

Patience is key here, as price may oscillate near these supports before momentum shifts in favor of buyers.
