Zcash (ZEC) is forming a complex diametric pattern on the 3D chart that may favor bullish continuation. This structure suggests a potential push higher to complete wave G, with two key technical zones highlighted as primary targets. If the leg extends further, a retest of previous highs could also come into play.

ðŸ“Š Analysis Update:  
Despite initial doubts about the unusual pattern, ZEC has already delivered nearly 20% upside while broader markets remain weak. For leveraged positions, booking partial profits is prudent, while holding the remainder in line with the roadmap until wave G completes remains a valid strategy.
