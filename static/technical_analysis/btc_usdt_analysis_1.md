## 📉 Market Reset After Recent Dump:

With last night’s sharp decline, it’s time to refresh our roadmap for the crypto market. If we consider this brutal move as the start of a new correctional pattern, wave A is likely followed by a retracement in the form of wave B before continuing downward.

## First Resistance Hit:

Since publishing our initial BTC insight, the first resistance line has been touched after a 7% growth. 📈
Looking at the weekly timeframe, last week’s dump has turned into a pin bar candle created by big investors. This changes the narrative from a purely bearish start to a more nuanced market movement. 🧐

We can speculate that in the coming days, BTC price will likely trade between the layers of this pin bar to fulfill remaining orders before the next significant move. 🌐

## Scalp Target Achieved

Our first scalp TP1 target is complete, achieving a 7.5% gain. 📈
Price is moving according to our roadmap, providing excellent trading opportunities. As suggested, booking 50% around this level and waiting for a minor reaction can set the stage for moving toward the second target. ✔️

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to follow the roadmap we outlined, with short scalp targets fully met and long scalp positions:

🔴 **SHORT SCALP** - FULL TARGET ✔️
🟢 **LONG SCALP** - 7.5% Growth

So far price is following our roadmap to the letter and seems to be aiming for another swing high before it CAN continue to our highlighted lower support levels. ↗️

Pay attention that there are two technical levels for #BTC rejection now. The quality of reaction to each zone and form of candles is important. If you are trading with this roadmap, make sure to book partial profits as price moves in the right direction. 🫴

Bitcoin (BTC) has respected the highlighted orange resistance line, confirming our short-term roadmap:

🔴 SHORT SCALP - 5.0% Target ✔️

As you CAN see price respected our orange highlighted resistant line, and although we saw some hype around it, price has been pulled back for more than 5% so far. 🛡

Since the small red scenario for #BTC to go higher and grab some liquidity from higher levels is still on the table as well, it best if scalpers take some profit around here & make their positions risk free. 🛡
