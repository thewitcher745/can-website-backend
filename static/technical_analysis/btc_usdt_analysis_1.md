## 📉 Market Reset After Recent Dump:

With last night’s sharp decline, it’s time to refresh our roadmap for the crypto market. If we consider this brutal move as the start of a new correctional pattern, wave A is likely followed by a retracement in the form of wave B before continuing downward.

## First Resistance Hit:

Since publishing our initial BTC insight, the first resistance line has been touched after a 7% growth. 📈
Looking at the weekly timeframe, last week’s dump has turned into a pin bar candle created by big investors. This changes the narrative from a purely bearish start to a more nuanced market movement. 🧐

We can speculate that in the coming days, BTC price will likely trade between the layers of this pin bar to fulfill remaining orders before the next significant move. 🌐

## Scalp Target Achieved

Our first scalp TP1 target is complete, achieving a 7.5% gain. 📈
Price is moving according to our roadmap, providing excellent trading opportunities. As suggested, booking 50% around this level and waiting for a minor reaction can set the stage for moving toward the second target. ✔️
