Taking a closer look at Solana’s strength against Bitcoin gives us valuable insight into where altseason currently stands. 💡
Based on the chart and overall technical analysis, SOL appears to be nearing the end of its Re-Accumulation phase, which often signals a major shift in momentum.

With both the blue and black scenarios in view, the structure suggests that this altcoin may soon regain strong momentum against BTC. 🔋
Once this bullish leg begins, other alts and even the memecoins within Solana’s ecosystem often follow with similar strength and that’s how a true altseason typically kicks off. 🔴
