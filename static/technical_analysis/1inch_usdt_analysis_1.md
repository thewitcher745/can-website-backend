1INCH is currently trading within a range and may soon break (likely not in favor of bulls.)🚫
If October’s corrections marked the start of an ABC pattern, this range could represent wave (B). 🕯

A break below support would confirm wave (C) as the final leg. However, a retracement to the top of the range is still possible, so be sure to manage risk carefully while waiting for clear signals. 📥📝
