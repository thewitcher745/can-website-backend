**Momentum Awakens â€“ Is ETHFI Setting the Stage for a New Rally?**

EthereumFi (ETHFI) is developing an intricate diametric pattern that could shape the next major price movement. The ongoing structure hints at another potential drive toward lower levels, offering long-term traders an opportunity to position for the next recovery phase.

ðŸ’¡ **Market Insight**  
Wave D appears to be forming a smaller diametric structure within the broader pattern, indicating that ETHFI may revisit lower support before initiating a new bullish move. This setup could present an attractive buying opportunity as the next waves unfold.

ðŸ“Œ **Trading Strategy**  
The roadmap points toward progressive profit-taking opportunities from waves E through G. Traders should remain cautious, as deeper-than-expected corrections may invalidate the setup â€” applying strict risk management is key.

ðŸ“Š **Price Update**  
The anticipated pullback didnâ€™t occur, and wave D concluded earlier than expected. A strong bullish candle now confirms the beginning of wave Eâ€™s recovery phase. A confirmed breakout above resistance could drive ETHFI toward two higher target levels before the next leg develops.
