Right now we’re simply waiting for WLD to reach its lower support zones. We’re not buyers until the price becomes cheaper and offers a cleaner technical reaction. 📉

Based on the current chart and overall technical analysis, we’re watching two main support areas where wave E can complete. These zones align with both recovery scenarios we’re tracking, so patience is key until price taps into one of them. ⏱

Once the structure confirms a shift in momentum, we’ll have stronger signals to evaluate a potential entry with proper risk management.
