## Rebuying Strategy & Entry Zones ðŸ“Œ

The most strategic point for re-entry into CAKE is near the completion of wave (F). Traders should watch the highlighted support areas closely:

Spot traders can plan accumulation around these levels

Short-term traders can look for lower timeframe confirmations to capture intraday opportunities

This approach allows for flexible trading strategies depending on your timeframe preference.

## Lower Timeframe Opportunities ðŸ“ˆ

Beyond the weekly chart, the roadmap can be applied to shorter timeframes to exploit price reactions at key zones. Pay attention to volume spikes and candle patterns in the highlighted areas to identify actionable entries.

Traders combining weekly context with lower timeframe setups can maximize efficiency and risk-adjusted returns.
