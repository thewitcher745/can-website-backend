The DOTUSDT weekly chart indicates that the market is in a redistribution phase. During this period, the coin may experience sideways to downward movements as selling pressure absorbs previous buying. For investors, this implies that DOT is not yet ideal for entry until it reaches stronger support levels.

## Key Scenarios for Buyers üßê

We are tracking two possible paths for Polkadot in the near term:

**Regular Pullback (Black Scenario) üìâ:** A moderate retracement toward the nearest support zones, offering potential low-risk accumulation opportunities.

**Extreme Correction (Blue Scenario) üì•:** A deeper move below the previous lows to capture liquidity before resuming upward momentum.

Traders should consider both scenarios when planning positions and avoid chasing the market prematurely.

## Support Zones to Monitor üìå

Careful attention should be given to highlighted lower support levels, as these zones could mark the ideal entry points for long-term investors. Confirming buying pressure in these areas can signal the start of a new accumulation phase and potential next bullish leg.
