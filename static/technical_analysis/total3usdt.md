The TOTAL3 index, which tracks the altcoin market excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, appears to have officially entered the correctional wave B phase that was anticipated in previous outlooks. This move aligns with the broader roadmap, suggesting that despite the current retracement, opportunities remain for strategic accumulation in upcoming support zones.

ðŸ”Ž **Technical Update**  
Altcoin volatility remains confined within the highlighted consolidation box, consistent with earlier forecasts. The recent 8.8% correction was expected, reinforcing that wave B is still in progress.  

ðŸ“Œ **Forward View**  
Such corrections often set the stage for stronger upward moves. If the index revisits the lower boundary of the box, it could strengthen the foundation for the next bullish leg.

ðŸ“Š **Chart Update**  
TOTAL3 has broken below its key trendline, confirming the completion of wave (C) in the smaller ABC structure. On a higher timeframe, another ABC pattern is visible, indicating the potential for larger recovery targets once this pullback ends.  

ðŸª™ **Investment Perspective**  
Two scenarios remain in play for the recovery wave (black and blue lines). A layered accumulation strategy across different price levels is advisable to capture the next market rebound.
