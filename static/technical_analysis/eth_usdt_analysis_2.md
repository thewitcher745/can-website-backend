ðŸ“Š **Market Insight**  
Ethereumâ€™s price action suggests the possibility of an Up Thrust (UT) as the bullish move continues. Lower timeframes may offer short-term opportunities for scalpers, while the broader structure indicates caution for new swing entries.  

ðŸª™ **Trading Strategy**  
Scalping on lower timeframes can be considered to ride the remaining upside. Swing traders should wait for price to revisit lower zones before positioning. For short trades, patience is keyâ€”confirmation is needed before entering to avoid premature risk.
