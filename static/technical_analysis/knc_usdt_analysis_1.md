## Monthly Demand Zone Hit:
Our expectation for KNC to visit the highlighted monthly demand zone happened within minutes, despite market makers pushing the coin around. This confirms the validity of our previous analysis.

## ðŸ§² First Target: Trendline Ahead:

With a 40% recovery so far, the main obstacle is the big trendline ahead, which serves as our first target point (TP1).

## âœ” Analysis Still Valid:

Keep in mind: as long as KNC trades near the monthly demand zone, this analysis remains valid. Once TP1 is properly broken, the next targets will be unlocked.
