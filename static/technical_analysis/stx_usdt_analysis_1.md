The recent long shadow on the #STXUSDT weekly chart appears to be only the beginning of a broader correction phase, a move designed to shake out weak hands and prepare the market for the next accumulation wave.

As lower support levels have already been unlocked, most smart buyers are now waiting for safer zones to re-enter the market and accumulate positions ahead of the next rally.

## Key Support & Entry Zone ðŸŽ¯

The highlighted demand zone marks the probable end of wave D, where new buying pressure could start building.
This level acts as a strong base for traders who want to catch the upcoming reversal.

However, patience is essential here, jumping in too early might expose traders to short-term volatility as price searches for a true bottom.

### Breakout Potential Ahead ðŸš€

Once wave D completes and price establishes support, the focus will shift to breaking above the major trendline highlighted on the chart.
A successful breakout could trigger momentum toward the upper target zones, confirming the next leg of the bullish structure.

Until that happens, the strategy remains clear: wait, observe, and prepare buy orders near the marked demand area.
