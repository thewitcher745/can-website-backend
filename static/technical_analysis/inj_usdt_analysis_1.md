## 🌐 Big-Picture Recap

We’re zooming out on Injective (INJ) to get a clearer view of where things stand. Our earlier roadmap projected a long corrective journey downward starting from the $13 rejection zone, and that’s exactly what happened. ☄️

## ⚡ Rapid Play-Out

Although the original plan was meant to unfold over weeks or months, market makers moved fast, compressing that entire move into just minutes. Since then, INJ has bounced over 135% from deep within our buy zone, confirming that the setup played out beautifully. ⚡️

## 💱 What’s Next

At this stage, the smartest move is to secure profits and wait for another pullback toward lower supports before re-entering. If the market gives us another opportunity, that’s where the next high-probability trade will be waiting. 📉
