The recent sharp drop appears to have completed wave (b), with price breaking below the highlighted trendline, signaling weakness in the current ORDI structure. 🚮
This breakdown suggests a shift in momentum and confirms the transition toward the expected next phase of movement.

## 📉 Wave (c) Movement & ORDI Retracement Potential:

As price progresses inside wave (c), there is a realistic chance of a retracement back toward the broken trendline. This type of pullback is common in corrective structures and may serve as a temporary recovery move before further downside. 🫰

## 🎯 ORDI Selling Opportunity at Key Trendline:

If price revisits the broken trendline resistance, it could offer a high-probability selling opportunity, especially if rejection or bearish candles appear at that level. ☄️
Patience is key! waiting for confirmation increases the odds of a successful entry.

## ▶️ Short Scalp TP1 Hit: 11.78% ✅

The retracement back to the broken trendline played out exactly as expected, and ORDI has continued its correction nearly 12% from the setup. ☄️

At this stage, it's smart to book at least 50%, lock the trade risk-free, and let the remaining position ride toward the second target. ✔️
