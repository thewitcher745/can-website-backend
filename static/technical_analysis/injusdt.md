Since our last update, Injective (INJ) has continued its impressive rebound, completing nearly a 70% recovery move on the weekly chart.

📍However, with price now approaching a key resistance zone—highlighted as a "danger area" in our roadmap—traders should consider locking in profits. Caution is advised as volatility may increase, and a decisive breakout or rejection could define the next major move. ⚠️

🎯 Strategy Tip:
Secure your profit on this coin, reduce heavy exposure, and wait patiently for a confirmed breakout or a healthy retracement before re-entering.
