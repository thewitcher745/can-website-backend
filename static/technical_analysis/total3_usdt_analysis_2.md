desc: "The recent market dump has likely marked the end of wave (B) the same wave that had been fueling fresh inflows into the altcoin market. With that phase wrapping up, we could be entering a period where capital starts rotating out of altcoins in the coming months. ðŸ“‰"

The orange zone highlighted on the chart is the crucial resistance area to keep an eye on. If price fails to break above this level and instead gets rejected, it would confirm that wave (C) has begun opening the door for a deeper pullback in the altcoin market.

## ðŸ’» Strategic Takeaway

This roadmap acts as a guide for managing altcoin exposure in the near term. A confirmed rejection here would suggest scaling back on high-risk positions and waiting for more favorable re-entry levels later. Keep a close eye on that orange zone itâ€™s the make-or-break area for this chart. ðŸ‘€
