desc: "The recent market dump has likely marked the end of wave (B) the same wave that had been fueling fresh inflows into the altcoin market. With that phase wrapping up, we could be entering a period where capital starts rotating out of altcoins in the coming months. 📉"

The orange zone highlighted on the chart is the crucial resistance area to keep an eye on. If price fails to break above this level and instead gets rejected, it would confirm that wave (C) has begun opening the door for a deeper pullback in the altcoin market.

## 💻 Strategic Takeaway

This roadmap acts as a guide for managing altcoin exposure in the near term. A confirmed rejection here would suggest scaling back on high-risk positions and waiting for more favorable re-entry levels later. Keep a close eye on that orange zone it’s the make-or-break area for this chart. 👀

🟢 #Altcoins show solid recovery has gone up by +11%! 🟢
Buyers continue to push prices higher as TOTAL3, the altcoin market index, extends its rally by 11% from the recent low. ➕

Now, the index has reached the expected resistance zone, marking a critical turning point. Two scenarios are possible: a rejection from the highlighted orange zone, or a break above the previous high to clear remaining liquidity. 🕯

At this stage, traders should remain selective with open positions and cautious about direction, as the market sits at a decisive resistance level. ⚠️

## 🔴 Correction since Top: 17.94% 🔴

As expected, this index has continued its correction under wave C of the broader ABC pattern, following the roadmap accurately. 🔤

With nearly 18% downside so far, there’s room for a swing move upward, giving alts a brief breather before the chart likely continues lower again. 📉

Remember, this wave has three potential downside targets, and we’ve only reached the first one. Plan your altcoin positions and risk management carefully as the next levels can still be tapped. 💡

## 🔴 Index Correction since Top: 24%

We perfectly called the top on this index and warned what would likely happen to altcoins, and the chart has followed the roadmap accurately. 🧐

TOTAL3 has now reached the first major target zone, which means we can expect a swing move upward before it continues deeper into wave (C). 📉

If the index keeps respecting this roadmap, a short rally on alts could unfold, retracing back toward the **Flip Zone**. 🪧

The reaction inside this highlighted zone will be crucial as it will signal whether altseason is preparing to begin or if another wave of downside is coming. 🔔
