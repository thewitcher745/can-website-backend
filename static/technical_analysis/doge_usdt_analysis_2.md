## Unlocking Lower Support Levels

DOGE has already hinted that lower support levels remain open and could be revisited. The pattern unfolding since mid-2022 forms a large diametric structure, suggesting that price still needs to retest the bottom support zone before a stronger reversal can begin. 🔖

## 🔜 What to Expect Next

Although yesterday’s crash briefly tapped those levels, it didn’t attract enough buying volume to complete the move. This means wave C may still have room to push lower before the market finds the true bottom.

Traders should keep an eye on these key support areas, if DOGE revisits them, it could mark the start of the next accumulation phase. 📉
