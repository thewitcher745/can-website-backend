## Unlocking Lower Support Levels

DOGE has already hinted that lower support levels remain open and could be revisited. The pattern unfolding since mid-2022 forms a large diametric structure, suggesting that price still needs to retest the bottom support zone before a stronger reversal can begin. 🔖

## 🔜 What to Expect Next

Although yesterday’s crash briefly tapped those levels, it didn’t attract enough buying volume to complete the move. This means wave C may still have room to push lower before the market finds the true bottom.

Traders should keep an eye on these key support areas, if DOGE revisits them, it could mark the start of the next accumulation phase. 📉

Price has finally moved in the exact direction expected after spending a couple of weeks lingering around the retracement zone. 📉

With a 20% drop now completed according to the roadmap, we could soon see another retracement move forming near the highlighted technical orange zone. 🛡

If you're trading based on this chart, make sure to watch each highlighted level carefully as these zones can offer clean signals and trading setups on lower timeframes. 📈

## ▶️ Correction since Entry: 32.75%

Wave C of the inner ABC pattern inside leg (F) has now completed over 30% downside, moving exactly according to the roadmap. 📉

From here, small retracements are likely, but the main plan remains unchanged.
The highlighted gray zone is still the area where we look to make our move. 💵
