## ‚öôÔ∏è Wave C & Pullback Zone

At the moment, CELR is completing wave C within a larger corrective structure. This wave is crucial since it often defines the transition from correction to accumulation.

The pullback zone at the end of wave C, highlighted on the chart, could provide the perfect entry point for mid-term investors. This is where the market tends to ‚Äúshake out‚Äù weak hands before a potential reversal making it a spot to watch closely. üëÄ

## üß± Key Support Levels

The distance between support lines on this chart is worth noting. These levels act like springboards that can trigger momentum when liquidity builds up. However, the structure looks wide enough to invite volatility, meaning leverage trading here is risky.

Instead, focus on spot accumulation. small, consistent buys in this range could offer a strong risk-to-reward setup if the next wave begins forming soon. üí∞

## üìà Outlook & Strategy

If CELR maintains its structure and confirms strength above the mid-support zone, the path toward higher targets becomes clearer. While short-term moves may remain choppy, the macro structure looks ready for a slow but steady bullish recovery.

Patience is key, this is a setup that rewards strategic positioning rather than impulsive entries. ‚è≥
