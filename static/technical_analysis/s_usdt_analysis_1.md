## Wave C Projection and Demand Zone Setup 📊

Based on the Elliott Wave formation, wave C is expected to extend toward the highlighted monthly demand zone, where stronger accumulation may occur. This area aligns with long-term support and liquidity levels, making it a critical region for potential reversal setups once the correction completes.

## Strategic Insight for Traders 🎯

Traders should remain cautious during this retracement phase and avoid premature entries. The optimal opportunity could form once price confirms a reaction inside the highlighted demand zone, suggesting a shift in control from sellers to buyers.

The SUSDT weekly chart continues to respect its ABC corrective roadmap, with a likely downward move toward the monthly demand zone under wave C. 📉 Patience will be essential for spotting the next accumulation and potential long-term recovery phase.
