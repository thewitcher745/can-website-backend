It turns out the UTAD (Up Thrust After Distribution) may already be in place for Ethereum, signaling a possible exit by smart money. 🔴 Yesterday’s candlestick shows a clear SOW (Sign Of Weakness), which is reinforced by a broken trendline. These technical signals suggest that Ethereum could be entering a distribution phase, making this a critical moment for ETH traders and those following crypto market forecasts. 🚨

A retracement upwards toward the broken trendline could be the next high-probability trading opportunity. ETH price analysis indicates that monitoring this zone could provide strategic entry points for short-term or swing trades. 📌

## Why the Selling Climax Matters:

The main objective is spotting an SC (Selling Climax) on Ethereum. 🕯 This is the point where weak hands capitulate, completing the distribution phase. Recognizing this pattern early allows traders to prepare for the next potential upward trend. Incorporating Ethereum technical analysis into your strategy is key to maximizing profits during these phases.

## Key Levels and Watchpoints:

**Volume spikes:** High-volume downward moves confirm SOW and potential selling climax.

**Trendline retest:** This can act as resistance, presenting either a bear trap or a breakout opportunity.

**Phase transition:** Moving from distribution to accumulation signals a longer-term bullish trend.

The overall plan is still a distribution phase for **Ethereum** but since the previous highlighted zone that price is playing around right now is not strong enough it seems we have more games at hand. 🕯

As we are seeing strength in **BTC**, we CAN expect **ETH** to follow as well. 🔜

Let's see if price CAN break above the highlighted trendline to reach the LPSY (Last Point of Supply) before it is ready to continue its distribution or not? ⁉️
