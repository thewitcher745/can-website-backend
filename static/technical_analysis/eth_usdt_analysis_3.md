It turns out the UTAD (Up Thrust After Distribution) may already be in place for Ethereum, signaling a possible exit by smart money. 🔴 Yesterday’s candlestick shows a clear SOW (Sign Of Weakness), which is reinforced by a broken trendline. These technical signals suggest that Ethereum could be entering a distribution phase, making this a critical moment for ETH traders and those following crypto market forecasts. 🚨

A retracement upwards toward the broken trendline could be the next high-probability trading opportunity. ETH price analysis indicates that monitoring this zone could provide strategic entry points for short-term or swing trades. 📌

## Why the Selling Climax Matters:

The main objective is spotting an SC (Selling Climax) on Ethereum. 🕯 This is the point where weak hands capitulate, completing the distribution phase. Recognizing this pattern early allows traders to prepare for the next potential upward trend. Incorporating Ethereum technical analysis into your strategy is key to maximizing profits during these phases.

## Key Levels and Watchpoints:

**Volume spikes:** High-volume downward moves confirm SOW and potential selling climax.

**Trendline retest:** This can act as resistance, presenting either a bear trap or a breakout opportunity.

**Phase transition:** Moving from distribution to accumulation signals a longer-term bullish trend.

The main reaction point for the next recovery move remains the orange zone 📌. If the blue scenario plays out, we’ll provide a fresh update to keep traders informed. 💡

The overall plan is still a distribution phase for **Ethereum** but since the previous highlighted zone that price is playing around right now is not strong enough it seems we have more games at hand. 🕯

As we are seeing strength in **BTC**, we CAN expect **ETH** to follow as well. 🔜

Let's see if price CAN break above the highlighted trendline to reach the LPSY (Last Point of Supply) before it is ready to continue its distribution or not? ⁉️

⚡️ ETHUSDT has gained +10% since our last update! ⚡️ Although some red candles have appeared on lower timeframes, liquidity above the previous high still remains untapped. ⚠️

This suggests that opening short positions may still be risky, as market makers could be setting a trap to catch early shorters before the next major correction. 🚨 If this scenario unfolds, the highlighted zone marks the potential area for LPSY (Last Point of Supply) before momentum shifts. 📈

Ethereum’s lower-timeframe structure is forming a complex diametric pattern, now approaching the end of wave (f). ⚙️

As price hits the support zone for the third time, the next bounce may be weaker than expected, showing signs of exhaustion. ⚠️

The upcoming wave (g) recovery could depend heavily on the FOMC meeting results, which might trigger either a short-term lift or deeper correction. 📉

Stay patient, manage risk carefully, and watch for a confirmed breakout before entering new ETH trades. 🚀

Ethereum’s third touch of the support zone has successfully held so far, showing strong buying interest despite earlier weakness. 📈

As price consolidates within this zone, there’s a potential for a double bottom formation, which could trigger the next wave (g) to the upside if confirmed. 🚀

However, this bullish scenario depends on whether ETHUSDT can produce a strong breakout from the highlighted zone soon. Until then, patience is key. Let the structure confirm before entering. 🔑
