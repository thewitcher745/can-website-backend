ðŸª™ Price Action Note:  
As projected, weak bullish momentum forced a revisit of the buy zone to ease selling pressure. Ethereum approaches support again, preparing to consolidate buyer demand.  

ðŸš€ Multi-Timeframe Outlook:  
The higher timeframe roadmap unfolded as expected, with price reaching deep into support. On the lower timeframes, a strong break above resistance is required to confirm recovery. External factors, including global news, may heavily influence breakout quality.
