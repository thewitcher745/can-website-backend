## Distribution Phase & Trendline Risk ðŸš¨

The ongoing distribution phase could lead price to retest the highlighted bullish trendline. If this trendline is broken, lower support zones may come into play, potentially completing wave D.

Traders aiming to sell or short SOON should focus on the two highlighted technical zones. These areas serve as triggers for opening positions and managing risk effectively.

## Key Trading Considerations ðŸª§

Monitor trendline interactions and price reactions in highlighted zones

Look for candlestick patterns or volume spikes as confirmation

Plan positions carefully, as breaking lower supports could accelerate the downward move
