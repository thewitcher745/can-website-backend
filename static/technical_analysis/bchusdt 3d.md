Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSDT) is at a critical juncture on the 3D chart. Price action suggests two possible outcomes: a retracement toward previous 2024 highs to capture liquidity, or a breakdown through key support levels that could open the door for a deeper correction. Traders should remain cautious and look for confirmations before acting.

ðŸ’¡ Market Insight:

BCH is balancing between bullish retracement potential and bearish breakdown risks. The chart highlights a trendline that, if lost, may confirm a shift into a corrective phase, while liquidity above prior highs remains a magnet for possible upward tests.  

ðŸ“Œ Strategy Notes:

Both scenarios can yield trading opportunities, but discipline is key. Short-term momentum entries should only be taken with confirmation, whether itâ€™s a reclaim toward higher levels or a rejection signaling further downside.
