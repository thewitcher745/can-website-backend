Historical cycles and macro signals suggest crypto may delay its next major peak.

## Macro Factors
Inconsistent rate cuts and cautious Fed posture may prolong market upward trends.

## Cycle Patterns
Previous bull runs lasted longer than one year; early investor rotation may extend the cycle into 2026.

### Conclusion
Patience could be rewarded. Based on cycle timing and macro variables, 2026 could mark a stronger peak than 2025.
