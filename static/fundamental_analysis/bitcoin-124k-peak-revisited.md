desc: Though Bitcoin topped near $124K, several indicators suggest the move wasn’t the final peak—ongoing liquidity and momentum hint at further upside potential.

Bitcoin recently flirted with the $124K peak—but fresh data indicates this may not have been the final summit.

## Supporting Indicators
- **Sustained liquidity** around key levels suggests strong interest past all-time highs.  
- **Momentum signals** remain elevated, and volume hasn’t sharply declined.

### Verdict
While $124K feels significant, it may best be viewed as another milestone in a longer bullish story—not necessarily the final chapter.
