## Part 1: Understanding the Impulse and Correction Phases

When examining the **BNB weekly chart**, it becomes clear that the market has followed a distinct rhythm since inception â€” powerful **impulse waves** followed by prolonged **correction phases**. This recurring cycle defines the assetâ€™s structural growth and offers insight into its potential future trajectory.

### Phase Breakdown: Impulse and Correction Dynamics

BNBâ€™s historical performance can be segmented into several major impulses and corrections:

- **First Impulse (2017â€“2018):** BNB skyrocketed by **+123,789%** within 36 weeks as Binance Exchange gained mass adoption.  
- **First Correction (2018â€“2020):** Price retraced **-83%**, forming a two-year accumulation base.  
- **Second Impulse (2020â€“2021):** Powered by Binance Smart Chain and the DeFi wave, BNB rallied **+11,000%** in 15 months.  
- **Second Correction (2021â€“2023):** A **-73%** decline followed, marking a broad consolidation.  
- **Current Impulse (2023â€“Present):** Up **+1,700%** so far, suggesting a new expansion phase potentially targeting **$3,600â€“$10,000** if historical rhythm continues.

### The Changing Nature of Each Cycle

Each market cycle in BNBâ€™s history reflects evolving market maturity:

- Early impulses were short but explosive, typical of young speculative assets.  
- Corrections grew longer and more complex as liquidity deepened.  
- Recent impulses have been slower yet more sustainable, highlighting stronger ecosystem fundamentals.

This maturing cycle suggests that BNBâ€™s current impulse could take longer to complete â€” but with greater magnitude and endurance. Institutional interest and ecosystem expansion may sustain the rally beyond short-term speculation.

### MACD Indicator: Momentum Still Favors the Bulls

The **MACD indicator** on the weekly chart reinforces the bullish case:

- The MACD line recently **crossed above** the signal line â€” historically a precursor to major rallies.  
- The **momentum histogram** continues to rise with ample room before overbought conditions.  
- In past cycles, similar signals preceded multi-month upward trends.

Together, these metrics point to continued strength and support the argument for an extended bullish wave into 2025 and beyond.

### Conclusion of Part 1

The recurring impulse-correction structure, combined with favorable momentum indicators, paints a picture of a market entering a mature yet powerful expansion phase. If history repeats, BNB could be on track for its most sustained growth cycle yet, with higher price targets on the horizon.

## Part 2: NEO Wave Perspective and Structural Pattern

Applying **NEO Wave theory** reveals a deeper structural rhythm in BNBâ€™s long-term market movement. The coin appears to be unfolding within a **large-scale symmetric or diametric formation**, representing a complex yet organized wave sequence that could continue developing for years.

### Wave Count Breakdown According to NEO Wave Theory

Based on current structural analysis:

- **Wave A:** The initial impulsive advance, lifting BNB from its inception to around $25 â€” fueled by early exchange adoption.  
- **Wave B:** A broad corrective phase marked by extended sideways accumulation.  
- **Wave C:** Another strong bullish expansion to new highs.  
- **Wave D:** A triangle correction, showing tightening volatility before breakout.  
- **Wave E:** Completed as an internal Aâ€“Bâ€“C pattern, finishing the symmetric structure.

Currently, BNB appears to be in **Wave C** of the next higher-degree pattern â€” typically the strongest and most directional leg of the cycle.

### Projected Targets Based on NEO Wave and Fibonacci Confluence

By combining **Fibonacci projection** and **wave proportionality**, potential long-term targets emerge:

- **$3,635** â€” initial Fibonacci extension target  
- **$6,792** â€” extended projection aligning with broader symmetry  

These confluences strengthen the argument for a continued upward trend and validate the potential for a $5,000+ valuation within the current expansion phase.

### Summary of the NEO Wave Outlook

The NEO Wave perspective indicates that Binance Coin remains in the midst of a **multi-year structural expansion**. While full pattern completion may take time, the ongoing wave structure suggests room for substantial growth. If the current impulse continues to evolve as expected, BNB could see its next major milestones between **$3,600 and $10,000** â€” driven by both technical structure and sustained market confidence.
