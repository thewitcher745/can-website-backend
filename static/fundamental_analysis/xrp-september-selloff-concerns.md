## Technical Indicators
XRP has breached key support zones, while volume remains relatively lean—suggesting vulnerability in coming weeks.

## Market Sentiment
Global economic worries and volatile investor sentiment add pressure, yet XRP continues to benefit from strong institutional adoption and utility cases.

### Outlook
A short-term dip is possible in September. However, XRP’s fundamentals and ecosystem developments may cushion long-term downside—making a crash less likely, though not impossible.
