Chart tools provide conflicting views on Bitcoin’s position in the current bull run.

## Rainbow Chart
Still below “bubble territory,” this visual indicator suggests Bitcoin may have more room to rise.

## BTI (Bitcoin Top Indicator)
With a score of **6.34 out of 12**, the BTI signals we’re midway between “endgame” and “euphoria”—a more cautious warning.

### Verdict
Relying solely on one signal isn’t enough. Combine technical charts with Fed policy and macro dynamics to determine whether we’re near a peak—or just warming up.
